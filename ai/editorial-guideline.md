## Writing criteria

- ✅ Address readers directly ("you," "your").
- ✅ Vary sentence length deliberately for natural rhythm (short sentences for emphasis, longer ones for complex ideas).
- ✅ Be specific, concise, and clear. Remove fluff.
- ✅ Assume the reader has a technical background but may be new to the specific tools or concepts discussed.
- ✅ Begin with a brief introduction outlining the problem and the proposed solution.
- ✅ Use plain language and define acronyms or specialized terms upon first use.
- ✅ Use markdown formatting consistently:
    - ✅ Labeled code blocks for longer code examples.
    - ✅ Italics for emphasis (avoid bold, except for labels like "Pros"/"Cons").
    - ✅ Use markdown headers (sentence case) to clearly structure ideas.
    - ✅ The blog post title must not be included in the content
    - ✅ Limit all lines to a maximum of 80 characters to enhance readability and maintain consistency across documents.
- ✅ Include diagrams to support complex explanations when appropriate (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, architecture diagrams).
    - ✅ Use only Mermaid or GoAT (ASCII) formats compatible with Hugo's content rendering.
    - ✅ Enclose diagram code within fenced code blocks, specifying the appropriate language identifier (mermaid or goat).
- ✅ Maintain a logical flow, guiding the reader through the setup, implementation, and results.
- ✅ Highlight potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- ✅ When showing code or tools, explain why something is done, not just how.
- ✅ Cite credible sources, standards, or tools to back up your claims.
- ✅ Ensure factual and technical accuracy.
- ✅ Conclude with a summary of outcomes and possible next steps or improvements.
- ✅ Include real-world concrete examples or practical use cases.
- ✅ Follow the provided brand voice and tone guidelines.
- ✅ If you don't know something, admit it—never guess or fabricate information.
- ✅ Use sentence case for headings and post titles ("This is a title").
- ❌ Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex language.
- ❌ Avoid filler phrases, wordiness, vague language, or repetition.
- ❌ Avoid overly formal or uncommon words (e.g., "delve," "notwithstanding").
- ❌ Avoid hype, clichés, marketing speak, or buzzwords.
- ❌ Avoid AI giveaways (robotic phrases, overly generic definitions).
- ❌ Avoid bullet-point and headings structured as key/value, e.g. "Something: Definition..."
- ❌ Avoid trailing participial phrases (", allowing...", ", making it easier..."); rewrite these clearly into full clauses.
- ❌ Avoid semicolons, emojis, hashtags, or stylized punctuation.
- ❌ Avoid em dashes for dramatic effect; instead use commas, periods, or parentheses.
- ❌ Avoid excessive capitalization or acronyms without definition.
- ❌ Avoid overused setups (e.g., "Let's dive deep into...").
- ❌ Do not assume the reader has prior knowledge of the author's previous work or projects.
- ❌ Do not provide code snippets
- ❌ Don't write tutorials or how-to content unless explicitly requested.
- ❌ Don't use generic intros or conclusions.
- ❌ Don't use unnatural phrasing or keyword stuffing.
- ❌ Don't use formulaic transitions (e.g., "In today's rapidly evolving landscape...").
- ❌ Don't use empty intensifiers (e.g., "incredibly important").
- ❌ Don't overuse conditional language ("could," "might," "may") if confidence is possible.
- ❌ Refrain from using marketing language or making unsubstantiated claims.
