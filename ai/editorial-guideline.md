##  Writing criteria
- ✅ Assume your reader is technical and curious, but not necessarily an expert.
- ✅ Open with a short, strong intro explaining why the topic matters and what readers will learn.
- ✅ Write like a practitioner speaking to fellow practitioners.
- ✅ Use plain, simple, everyday language; clearly explain any necessary jargon.
- ✅ Be specific, concise, and clear. Remove fluff.
- ✅ Use active voice.
- ✅ Address readers directly ("you," "your").
- ✅ Vary sentence length deliberately for natural rhythm (short sentences for emphasis, longer ones for complex ideas).
- ✅ Maintain a conversational tone (avoid robotic or overly formal).
- ✅ Ensure factual and technical accuracy.
- ✅ Cite credible sources, standards, or tools to back up your claims.
- ✅ When showing code or tools, explain why something is done, not just how.
- ✅ Use markdown formatting consistently:
    - Inline code formatting for short snippets or commands.
    - Labeled code blocks for longer code examples.
    - Italics for emphasis (avoid bold, except for labels like "Pros"/"Cons").
    - Use markdown headers (sentence case) to clearly structure ideas.
- ✅ Include real-world concrete examples or practical use cases.
- ✅ Limit line length to 120 characters.
- ✅ Follow the provided brand voice and tone guidelines.
- ✅ If you don't know something, admit it—never guess or fabricate information.
- ✅ Use sentence case for headings and post titles ("This is a title").
- ❌ Avoid filler phrases, wordiness, vague language, or repetition.
- ❌ Avoid overly formal or uncommon words (e.g., "delve," "notwithstanding").
- ❌ Don’t write tutorials or how-to content unless explicitly requested.
- ❌ Don’t use generic intros or conclusions.
- ❌ Don’t use unnatural phrasing or keyword stuffing.
- ❌ Avoid hype, clichés, marketing speak, or buzzwords.
- ❌ Avoid AI giveaways (robotic phrases, overly generic definitions).
- ❌ Avoid headings structured as "Something: Definition..."
- ❌ Avoid trailing participial phrases (", allowing...", ", making it easier..."); rewrite these clearly into full clauses.
- ❌ Don’t overuse conditional language ("could," "might," "may") if confidence is possible.
- ❌ Avoid semicolons, emojis, hashtags, or stylized punctuation.
- ❌ Avoid em dashes for dramatic effect; instead use commas, periods, or parentheses.
- ❌ Avoid excessive capitalization or acronyms without definition.
- ❌ Don’t use formulaic transitions (e.g., "In today's rapidly evolving landscape...").
- ❌ Avoid overused setups (e.g., "Let's dive deep into...").
- ❌ Don’t use empty intensifiers (e.g., "incredibly important").
